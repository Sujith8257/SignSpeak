# SignSpeak Docker Compose
# 
# CAMERA ACCESS:
# - LINUX:   Use docker-compose.linux.yml instead (camera works)
#            docker-compose -f docker-compose.linux.yml up --build
# - WINDOWS: Camera does NOT work in Docker (Windows cameras aren't exposed to Linux containers)
#            Use "python app.py" directly on Windows for camera access
#
# This file is for Windows/Mac or when camera is not needed (e.g., testing UI)
